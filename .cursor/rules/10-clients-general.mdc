# Chainfall Clients (All Renderers)

## Responsibilities

- Clients are **renderers + input** only.
- Game rules/state transitions MUST live in `packages/game-core`.
- Shared message schemas/types MUST live in `packages/protocol`.

## Cross-client consistency

- All clients must:
  - consume the same server protocol
  - render the same authoritative state
  - never re-implement game rules locally

## UI / UX basics

- Prefer simple, obvious UI over clever abstractions.
- Make controls touch-friendly (mobile considerations apply to all clients).

## Performance basics

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders / redraws.
- Keep per-frame work minimal (especially for Phaser/Three).
- Prefer event-driven redraw for turn-based UI when possible.

## AI checklist (clients)

- No rule logic in client.
- No duplicated constants: import from packages.
- Keep code readable; avoid overengineering.
